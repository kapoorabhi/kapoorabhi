### Hi there 👋


👨🏻‍💻 Officially, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer and spend most of my 9 - 5 time creating things with React JS, Node JS, and other web technologies.

⚽ My evenings are dedicated to a game of FIFA with a cup of tea ☕ followed by working on some side projects. Hah, we all know how side projects are.

Few things I like to spend my time on.
