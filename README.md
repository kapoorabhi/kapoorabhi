### Hi there 👋


👨🏻‍💻 Officially, I am working as a Front-End Engineer. I spend most of my 9 - 5  time  creating things with React JS.

💻 Currently, I am trying to get my hands dirty with Svelte JS as well. Fork my repo [pwd-protect](https://github.com/kapoorabhi/pwd-protect "pwd-protect") to checkout the source code.

⚽ Evenings are dedicated to a game of FIFA with a cup of tea. ☕
